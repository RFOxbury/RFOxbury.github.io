Hello!

I recently submitted my PhD in Linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. I am a variationist sociolinguist and sociophonetician working on Multicultural London English.

You can use the tabs at the top of the page to look at my academic papers and conference presentations, and some of my R notebooks. I'm grateful for any feedback on this work -- particularly if you spot glaring errors!
