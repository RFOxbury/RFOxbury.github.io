Hello! I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. I am a variationist sociolinguist working on: sociophonetics -- specifically, changes in the diphthongs in Multicultural London English; discourse pragmatic variation and change. I also do discourse analysis but sadly, this isn't part of my PhD!
