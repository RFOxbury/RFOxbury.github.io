I'm a data scientist working for Public Health England.

In a former life I was a linguist. Early on in my PhD I found that I loved data, stats and R, but hated academia, so once I had finished, I did Science 2 Data Science in March--April 2021. S2DS opened my eyes to the joys of teamwork, Jira boards and version control, while also affirming for me that data science was the right career choice. Since then, I've had a freelance contract at Pivigo working on their first "S2DS-Pro" project, and more recently started a contract at PHE.

This site is in progress. Using the tabs at the top, you can currently see a few of my R notebooks and some relics from my time in academia. More work will be added shortly.
